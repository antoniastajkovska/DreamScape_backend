## üß± Booking Workflow Logic

Here is the expected flow of how booking works, matching what‚Äôs implemented in the frontend:

1. User requests flights / hotel / taxi availability.  
2. User selects:
   - Flight (with ticket type(s): senior, adult, child)  
   - Optional hotel (can skip)  
   - Optional taxi (can skip)  
3. On submit, backend validates data (e.g., user is authenticated) and persists booking into the database.  
4. Backend generates a receipt / summary record.  
5. Retrieval of booking and receipt by the frontend for display to user.
